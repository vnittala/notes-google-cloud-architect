# Google Cloud Load Balancing

[Google Cloud Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/) can be used to load balance user requests among sets of instances.

| Name      | Internet | Internal | Single Region | Multi-Region  |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| HTTP(S)   | Yes      | No       | Yes           | Yes           |
| SSL Proxy | Yes      | No       | No            | Yes           |
| TCP Proxy | Yes      | No       | No            | Yes           |
| TCP LB    | Yes      | Yes      | Yes           | Use TCP Proxy |
| UDP LB    | Yes      | Yes      | Yes           | No            |

## Features

* Global external load balancing.
  * HTTP(S) load balancing.
  * SSL Proxy load balancing.
  * TCP Proxy load balancing.
* Regional external load balancing (TCP/UDP).
* Regional internal load balancing (TCP/UDP).
* HTTP(S) will terminate on the load balancer (central SSL certificates).
* Can use TCP load balancer for HTTP(S) however it will terminate on the instance.
* Integrates with Managed Instance Groups.

## Forwarding Rules

* Consist of name, region, IP address, protocol, ports, target-pool or target-instance.
* Managed with GCP Console, gcloud, or REST API.

## Target Pools

* Max of 50 per project
* Instances can be in different zones within a region.
* SessionAffinity influences load distribution.
  * NONE: hash of source IP, source port, protocol, dest IP, dest port.
  * CLIENT_IP_PROT: specific protocols from the client end up on a single instance.
  * CLIENT_IP: all connections from the client end up on the same instance.

## HTTP(S) Load Balancing

* Distributes traffic base on proximity to the user or URL or both.
* Supports multiple regions.
* Supports autoscalers.

### HTTP(S) Load Balancing Backend

* Comprised of:
  * A health check.
  * Session affinity settings.
  * One or more backend services.
* Consists of:
  * An instance group (managed or unmanaged).
  * A balancing mode (CPU or Rate in req/sec).
  * A capacity scaler (ceiling % or CPU/Rate targets).
* Supports up to 500 endpoints per zone.
* Supports URL mapping to service instances.
* Blocks illegal requests adding security.
* Writes request information into Stackdriver logs.

## Managed Instance Groups

* Deploys identical instances based on an instance template.
* Instance group can be resized.
* Manager ensures all instances are in a running state.
* Used with autoscaler.
* Single zone or regional.
* Support connection draining:
  * Delays termination of an instance until existing connections are closed or timeout (1 to 3600 sec).
  * New connections are prevented.
* Triggered when an instance is removed from a group either by manual removal, resizing, autoscaling, etc.
* Instance Group Updater:
  * Zero downtime and staggered releases.
  * Use Instance Group Updater to apply a rolling update.
  * Apply canary updates with rollback.
* Autohealing:
  * Automated server monitoring and restarts.
  * If health check sees a failed service, re-create the instance.
* Balances instances across three zones in a region.

### Regional Managed Instance Groups Best Practices

* Overprovision your services.
* Test using the "failure_zone" special tag.

## Securing Load Balanced Servers

* A firewall rule must be created for the appropriate networks.
* Create firewall rules to only allow traffic from the GCP Load Balancer networks (130.211.0.0/22).
* Have no external IP addresses (use a bastion host for management purposes).
