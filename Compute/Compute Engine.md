# Compute Engine

Google Compute Engine lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.

[Google Compute Engine Concepts](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/concepts)

## Features

* Large-scale IaaS workloads.
* High CPU, high memory, standard, and shared-core machine types.
* Persistent disks on standard (HDD), SSD, and local SSD.
* Resize disks and migrate instances with no downtime.
* Startup scripts and metadata.
* Robust networking:
  * Default and custom networks.
  * Firewall rules.
  * Regional HTTP(s) load balancing.
  * Network load balancing.
  * Subnetworks.
* Advanced APIs for auto-scaling and instance group management.
* Per-minute billing with sustained use discounts.
* Preemptible instances.
* High throughput to storage at no extra cost.
* Custom machine types allow you to only pay for what you need.
* Import VM uses Cloud Endure. Super easy.

## Points of Interest

* Windows virtual machines require you to set a username and password.
* Configuration management options include:
  * Startup script for Compute instances.
  * Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
  * Open-source tools such as Pupper, Chef, Salt, and Ansible.

## Shutdown Script

* Resetting an instance does not run the shutdown script.
* Restart, reboot, stop, shutdown, delete will allow approximately 90 seconds for the shutdown script to run.
* Preemptible machines will allow only 30 seconds for the shutdown script to run.

## Changing Machine Type

* Set the boot disk to not be deleted when the virtual machine is deleted.
* Delete the virtual machine instance.
* Create a new instance with the new machine type settings.
* Select the boot disk from the existing disks.

## Preemptible Machines

* Lower price for interruptible service (up to 80%),
* May be terminated at any time:
  * No charge if within 10 min.
  * 24 hours max run time.
  * 30 second termination notification.
* No live migrate.
* No auto restart.
* Can request a CPU quota be split between regular and preemption.

## Disks

* HDD or SSD.
* Live disk resizing (bigger, not smaller).
* Supports attachment to multiple VMs in read only mode.
* Automatic Checksums.
* Automatic Encryption (can supply own keys).
* Persistent Disk:
  * Network storage appearing as a block device.
  * Attached to the VM through the network interface.
  * Durable storage.
  * Bound to zone.
  * Bootable.
  * Snapshots.
* Local SSD Disk:
  * Physically attached to VM.
  * Not available on shared core.
  * Faster than Persistent disk.
  * Ephemeral: data survives a restart but not a stop or terminate.
  * 3TB (375GB * 8).
* RAM Disk:
  * tmpfs
  * Faster than Local SSD, slower than memory.
  * Very volatile.
  * RAM required so larger machine type needed.

| No of Cores | Disk Limit |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Shared Core | 16         |
| 1 Core      | 32         |
| 2-4 Cores   | 64         |
| 8 or more   | 128        |

## Moving a VM to a new zone

* Manual process:
  * Snapshot all persistent disks on the source VM.
  * Create new persistent disks in destination zone restored from snapshots.
  * Promote ephemeral external IP to static external IP.
  * Create new VM in the destination zone and attach new persistent disks.
  * Assign static IP to new VM, demote to ephemeral.
  * Update references to VM.
  * Delete the snapshots, original disks, and original VM.
* Automated process:
  * `gcloud compute instances move`
  * Update references to VM.

## Performance Management

* Region choice affects machine type and CPU architecture options.
* 1 vCPU is equal to 1 hyperthreaded core.
* 2 vCPUs is equal to 1 physical core.
* Network throughput is 2Gbps per vCPU up to 16Gbps for 8 vCPUs.
* Disk throughput is tied to the network throughput.
* Disk IOPs is tied to the disk size.
* Local SSD is ephemeral and ties the instance to the hardware.

## Availability Policy

* Preemptibility: On or Off.
* Automatic restart: On or Off.
* On host maintenance: Migrate or Terminate.
* GPUs will prevent migration on host maintenance.
* Local SSD disks will prevent migration on host maintenance.

## Pricing

* Per minute billing with a 10 minute minimum.
* Sustained use discounts.
* Preemptible instances:
  * Live at most 24 hours.
  * Can be pre-empted with a 30 second notification via API.
  * Up to 80% discount.
* Custom machine types will have custom pricing.
* Recommendation engine notifies of under utilized instances.
* Committed use discounts (1 year or 3 years).
* Inferred instance discounts: Usage of VMs of the same machine type in the same zone are combined as if they were one machine.
* No charge for stopped instances apart from attached disks and IPs.
* Same charge for different CPU architectures. Choose your region wisely.

## Autoscaling

* Automatically scale the number of instances in the managed instance group based on workload.
* Can reduce costs by shutting down instances when not required.
* Create one autoscaler per managed instance group.
* Support both zone-based managed instance groups or regional managed instance groups.
* It is fast responding typically within a 1 minute moving window.
* Policies include Max and Min number of replicas.
* Policy options:
  * Average CPU utilization.
  * HTTP load balancing serving capacity (backend service definition for Max CPU or Max req/sec/instance.)
  * Stackdriver standard and custom metrics.
  * Google Cloud Pub/Sub queuing workload.
* Supports up to 5 policies.
* Use Stackdriver custom metrics to autoscale more accurately to your application workload.

### Autoscaler Configuration

1. Create instance template (startup scripts, shutdown scripts, software, logging).
2. Create managed instance group.
3. create autoscaler.
4. Optionally, define multiple policies.
